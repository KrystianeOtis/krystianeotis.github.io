<!-- When drawing lines with SVG, you often have a <path> element with a stroke. You set a stroke-dasharray that is as long
    as the path itself, as well as a stroke-offset that extends so far that the entire stroked path appears hidden
    initially. Then you animate the stroke-offset back to 0 so you can watch it “draw” the shape.

    Figuring out the length of the path is the trick, which fortunately you can do in JavaScript by selecting the path
    and doing pathEl.getTotalLength(). It’ll probably be some weird decimal. A smidge unfortunate we can’t get that in
    CSS, but c’est la vie. -->
